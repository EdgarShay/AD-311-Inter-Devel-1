# Exploring JavaScript Spread Syntax

## Objective
This assignment practices using the JavaScript spread syntax in functions, arrays, and objects.

## Tasks Completed
- Expanded array elements into function arguments using spread syntax.
- Merged two arrays into one.
- Inserted elements at the beginning and end of an array.
- Cloned and modified an object without affecting the original.
- Combined two objects, ensuring later properties overwrite earlier ones.

## Key Concepts Learned
- `...array` expands array elements.
- `...object` copies object properties into a new object.
- Spread syntax helps avoid mutation and makes code cleaner and more readable.
