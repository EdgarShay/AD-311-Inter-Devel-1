In this assignment, I replaced each use of var with either let or const based on how the variable behaves
in the code. I used const for values that never change, such as age and loopArray,
because const prevents reassignment and makes the code more predictable.

I used let for variables that are reassigned or updated, such as fullName, MAXIMUM, colors,
and the loop counter i. Using const in those cases would cause errors
because const does not allow reassignment. Overall, the choice between let and const
depends on whether the variable’s value needs to change during the program.
const is best for fixed values, while let is best for values that change or are block-scoped.
